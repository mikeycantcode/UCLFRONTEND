# UCLFRONTEND
 Frontend for the uclend smart contracts. I deployed it using aws amplify here:    
 Still working on it and I started before I knew what react.js was so i'm already in too deep to change that. 
 
 Its currently made for my local blockchain network as I removed it from testnet testing to do an overhaul to make it prettier.
